                <h2>River Wye North</h2>
                <div><img class="image-embed" src="/assets/river-wye-map.jpg" alt="River Wye North"></div>
                <p>
                    The first section of the river goes through Hay on Wye which is famous for it's many book shops and
                    Hay Festival. The River Wye then continues through some of the best countryside the UK has to offer
                    with breathtaking views of the Brecon Beacons and Black Mountains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crossing the border into England the River Wye travels on to Hereford which is steeped in History
                    and takes it's name from being the lowest point of the River Wye "Ford" meaning crossing point,which
                    was used by Army's as the forming point "Here". From the river you can see Hereford Cathedral and
                    old battle grounds as you pass under Saxon and Victorian bridges. Hereford Cathedral is home to
                    British treasure including the Mappa Mundi and Chained Library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Hereford the River Wye continues to Ross on Wye and like Hay on Wye these settlements got
                    their names from being "upon" the River Wye. People that are familiar with these places tend to drop
                    the latter part and commonly refer to them just using the first part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ross on Wye is an old market town. From the river, you can see the distinctive church spire soaring
                    into the skyline. There are good public facilities next to the river including camp sites and places
                    to eat and drink.
                </p>

                <h2>River Wye South</h2>
                <div><img class="image-embed" src="/assets/river-wye-south.png" alt="River Wye South"></div>
                <p>
                    River Wye South, a great canoeing spot. After a short distance the river passes Goodrich Castle,
                    built
                    initially in the 11th century. The castle was named after it's founder Godric an English Thegn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Castle is open to the public and has a newly built visitors centre that offers free audio tours.
                    Goodrich overlooks Symonds Yat. Divided into Symonds Yat East & West, this scenic village in the
                    Forest of Dean has riverside camping and hotel accommodation.After Symonds Yat the River Wye turns
                    back towards Wales crossing into the Welsh market town of Monmouth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Monmouth is home to two other rivers, the Monnow and the Trothy. It is also the birth place of Henry
                    V and has many attractions and sites to visit. From Monmouth the Wye continues towards Tintern. From
                    the river, you have a fantastic view of Tintern Abbey, referred to by many as the "Perfect ruined
                    Abbey". The River Wye goes behind Tintern Abbey, giving canoeing groups a great aspect of the Abbey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warning: From here River Wye becomes tidal and groups with experienced paddlers should only continue
                    with a qualified instructor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last leg of the River Wye stretches between Tintern And Chepstow, before joining the River
                    Severn. Canoeing groups must reach Tintern by high tide allowing you to paddle with the out going
                    current to Chepstow. On arriving you'll see Chepstow Castle high upon the cliff top, giving an
                    impressive backdrop to the finish line. Once under the old bridge there is a pontoon to get off the
                    river, with good access and parking close by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today Chepstow is best known for horse racing, but historically it was a walled town with a fully
                    functioning port. Like all locations on the River Wye, Chepstow is a beautiful town with many
                    visiting tourists each year. There are many hotels, B&B's and guest houses along with some fantastic
                    places to eat and drink.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Tell someone where you are going, when you expect to return, and where to call if you don’t.
                    Ultimate will be your point of contact and we monitor your progress and safety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be sure your water skills and experience are equal to the river and the conditions. NEVER BOAT
                    ALONE.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wear a properly adjusted lifejacket at all times when you are in or near the river.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce injuries by wearing protective foot wear and proper clothing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be courteous to other river users, steer clear of others and obvious hazards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow any water craft ahead of you to pass through narrow channels before you enter it. This
                    will
                    avoid trouble if the leading boat blocks the channel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Canoeing and kayaking safely on the River Wye: When in doubt, stop and scout. If you are still
                    in
                    doubt? Portage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not drink alcohol or embark on water activities if on strong medication. Consult your doctor
                    if
                    in doubt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carry warm dry clothing – we supply you with water tight containers to keep them dry.
